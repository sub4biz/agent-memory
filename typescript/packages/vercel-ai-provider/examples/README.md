# Examples

One runnable example per integration mode — provider, middleware, tools, and
hooks — plus a mode switcher and a Next.js route template. All examples need a
free NAMS API key from [memory.neo4jlabs.com](https://memory.neo4jlabs.com) and
an OpenAI key (swap in any `@ai-sdk/*` provider if you prefer). No other
environment changes are needed to switch modes — mode selection is code-level.

```bash
export MEMORY_API_KEY=sk-nams-...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

| Example | Mode | Run |
|---------|------|-----|
| [`basic-chat.ts`](./basic-chat.ts) | Provider (transparent memory) — teaches a fact in session 1, recalls it in session 2 | `npx tsx examples/basic-chat.ts` |
| [`middleware-chat.ts`](./middleware-chat.ts) | Middleware — wraps an existing model instance; a fresh model in turn 2 recalls turn 1 | `npx tsx examples/middleware-chat.ts` |
| [`tools-chat.ts`](./tools-chat.ts) | Tools (model-driven) — `query_memory` / `store_memory` visible as tool calls; retrieval guaranteed via `enforceQueryMemory()` | `npx tsx examples/tools-chat.ts` |
| [`hooks-chat.ts`](./hooks-chat.ts) | Hooks (runtime-controlled) — the transcript is restored and saved around every generation, with no memory tools | `npx tsx examples/hooks-chat.ts` |
| [`advanced-hooks-chat.ts`](./advanced-hooks-chat.ts) | Lifecycle hooks — blocks a destructive tool, redacts a card number, carries context between turns | `npx tsx examples/advanced-hooks-chat.ts` |
| [`mode-switch-chat.ts`](./mode-switch-chat.ts) | The same conversation in whichever mode you pick | `NAMS_MODE=hooks npx tsx examples/mode-switch-chat.ts` |
| [`nextjs-chat-route.ts`](./nextjs-chat-route.ts) | Provider inside a Next.js App Router endpoint — copy into `app/api/chat/route.ts` | n/a (template) |

Each script's header comment shows the **expected output**, so you can compare
what you see locally — in provider and middleware mode the recall happens
silently inside the model call, while in tools mode the same memory operations
appear as visible `query_memory` / `store_memory` tool calls.

The scripts import from `../src` so they run directly against the source tree — no build step needed. In your own app, import from `@neo4j-labs/nams-ai-provider` instead.
