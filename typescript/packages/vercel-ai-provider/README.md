Community provider for the [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev) that adds persistent cross-session memory to any language model, backed by the [Neo4j Agent Memory Service (NAMS)](https://memory.neo4jlabs.com) — a **knowledge graph**, not a flat vector store: what the model recalls includes the relationships between the things it remembers.

On every turn, NAMS automatically retrieves relevant memories from the user's history and injects them into the prompt — then persists the response so future sessions remember it. No Neo4j infrastructure to manage.

## What does it do?

Without this package, every chat session starts fresh — the model has no recollection of who the user is, what they've said before, or what decisions were made in prior conversations.

`@neo4j-labs/nams-ai-provider` wraps your existing AI model and transparently adds memory to every call:

1. **Before the model responds** — NAMS searches its memory store for facts, preferences, and past interactions relevant to the current message, reads back the relationships around whatever matched, and injects both into the prompt automatically.
2. **After the model responds** — NAMS persists the exchange so the next session can recall it, and extracts entities from those messages into a Neo4j knowledge graph server-side.

The result: your AI remembers users across sessions without you changing your application logic.

```

## Setup

**1. Install the provider and its peer dependencies**

```bash
npm install @neo4j-labs/nams-ai-provider ai @neo4j-labs/agent-memory zod
```

**2. Get a free API key** at [memory.neo4jlabs.com](https://memory.neo4jlabs.com)

```env
MEMORY_API_KEY=sk-nams-...
```

---

## Quick Start

Once installed and your API key is set, adding memory to your Vercel AI SDK app is a one-line model swap:

```ts
// Before: plain agent, no memory
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import {
  ToolLoopAgent,
  createUIMessageStream,
  createUIMessageStreamResponse,
  stepCountIs,
} from 'ai';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model:        openai('gpt-5.4-mini'),
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  stopWhen:     stepCountIs(10),
});

const stream = createUIMessageStream({
  execute: async ({ writer }) => {
    const result = await agent.stream({ messages });
    writer.merge(result.toUIMessageStream());
  },
});

return createUIMessageStreamResponse({ stream });
```

```ts
// After: swap model → agent now remembers users across sessions
import { createNamsProvider } from '@neo4j-labs/nams-ai-provider';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import {
  ToolLoopAgent,
  createUIMessageStream,
  createUIMessageStreamResponse,
  stepCountIs,
} from 'ai';

const nams = createNamsProvider({
  apiKey:       process.env.MEMORY_API_KEY!,
  baseProvider: openai,
  scope:        { userId: 'user-123' },  // identify the user
});

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model:        nams.languageModel('gpt-5.4-mini'),  // ← only change
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  stopWhen:     stepCountIs(10),
});

const stream = createUIMessageStream({
  execute: async ({ writer }) => {
    const result = await agent.stream({ messages });
    writer.merge(result.toUIMessageStream());
  },
});

return createUIMessageStreamResponse({ stream });
```

**What happens automatically on every call:**
- Relevant memories for `user-123` — and the relationships around them — are fetched and prepended to the prompt
- The model's response is saved back to memory for future sessions
- No other code changes needed

## Usage Modes

There are four ways to integrate NAMS depending on how much control you want:

| Mode | How it works | Best for |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Provider** | Swap your model for a NAMS-wrapped one | Simplest integration, fully transparent |
| **Middleware** | Wrap an existing model instance | When you already have a model configured |
| **Tools** | Expose memory as explicit AI SDK tools (optionally merged with tools from an MCP server) | When you want the model to decide when to remember |
| **Hooks** | The runtime reads/writes the session transcript around every generation via AI SDK hooks — nothing memory-related is shown to the LLM | Production agents that need a deterministic, complete transcript |

Switching modes is purely a code-level choice — all four use the same API key
and environment variables (see [Environment variables](#environment-variables)).
To make it a deploy-time choice instead, see
[`examples/mode-switch-chat.ts`](examples/mode-switch-chat.ts): one agent whose
mode is selected by `NAMS_MODE=provider|middleware|tools|hooks`, all four
sharing the same memory backend so memories carry over between runs.
Middleware and tools modes can also be
[combined on one agent](#combining-tools-mode-with-middleware-hybrid) —
injected baseline context plus explicit memory tools.

> **How does this relate to `@neo4j-labs/agent-memory/middleware/vercel-ai`?**
> The core SDK ships a minimal middleware for the AI SDK 4.x-era
> `LanguageModelV1Middleware` shape that injects current-conversation context.
> This package targets AI SDK v7 / `LanguageModelV4` and adds a registrable
> `ProviderV4`, cross-session retrieval, optional graph extraction, explicit
> memory tools, and MCP tool merging. New projects should prefer this package.

---

## Provider Mode (ProviderV4)

Drop NAMS into any Vercel AI SDK project as a standard `ProviderV4`. Memory is fully transparent — no tools, no system prompt changes needed.

```ts
import { createNamsProvider } from '@neo4j-labs/nams-ai-provider';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import {
  ToolLoopAgent,
  createUIMessageStream,
  createUIMessageStreamResponse,
  stepCountIs,
} from 'ai';

// One instance per user session
const nams = createNamsProvider({
  apiKey:       process.env.MEMORY_API_KEY!,
  baseProvider: openai,               // any @ai-sdk/* provider
  scope:        { userId: session.userId },
});

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model:        nams.languageModel('gpt-5.4-mini'),
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  stopWhen:     stepCountIs(1),       // no tools needed in provider mode
});

const stream = createUIMessageStream({
  execute: async ({ writer }) => {
    const result = await agent.stream({ messages });
    writer.merge(result.toUIMessageStream());
  },
});

return createUIMessageStreamResponse({ stream });
```

Works with the provider registry:

```ts
import { createProviderRegistry as createRegistry } from 'ai';

const registry = createRegistry({
  nams: createNamsProvider({
    apiKey:       process.env.MEMORY_API_KEY!,
    baseProvider: openai,
    scope:        { userId },
  }),
});

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model:    registry.languageModel('nams:gpt-5.4-mini'),
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(1),
});
```

---

## Middleware Mode

Wrap any existing model instance with memory — useful when you already configure your model elsewhere and just want to decorate it:

```ts
import { createNams } from '@neo4j-labs/nams-ai-provider';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import {
  ToolLoopAgent,
  createUIMessageStream,
  createUIMessageStreamResponse,
  stepCountIs,
} from 'ai';

const nams  = createNams({ apiKey: process.env.MEMORY_API_KEY! });
const model = nams.wrap(openai('gpt-5.4-mini'), { userId: session.userId });

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({ model, stopWhen: stepCountIs(1) });

const stream = createUIMessageStream({
  execute: async ({ writer }) => {
    const result = await agent.stream({ messages });
    writer.merge(result.toUIMessageStream());
  },
});

return createUIMessageStreamResponse({ stream });
```

---

## Tools Mode

Expose `query_memory` and `store_memory` as explicit AI SDK tools. The model decides when to call them, and the calls are visible in your UI — useful for debugging or when you want the user to see memory activity:

```ts
import { createNams, enforceQueryMemory, ensureMemoryStored } from '@neo4j-labs/nams-ai-provider';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import {
  ToolLoopAgent,
  createUIMessageStream,
  createUIMessageStreamResponse,
  stepCountIs,
} from 'ai';

const nams  = createNams({ apiKey: process.env.MEMORY_API_KEY! });
const tools = nams.tools({ userId: session.userId });

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model:        openai('gpt-5.4-mini'),
  instructions:
    'Before answering, consult memory with query_memory. When the conversation ' +
    'contains facts or preferences worth remembering, call store_memory before ' +
    'giving your final answer.',
  tools,
  prepareStep:  enforceQueryMemory(),
  onFinish:     ensureMemoryStored(tools),
  stopWhen:     stepCountIs(10),
});

const stream = createUIMessageStream({
  execute: async ({ writer }) => {
    const result = await agent.stream({ messages });
    writer.merge(result.toUIMessageStream());
  },
});

return createUIMessageStreamResponse({ stream });
```

Tool descriptions and instructions are advisory — models routinely skip
"bookkeeping" tool calls. `enforceQueryMemory()` makes retrieval mechanical
instead: it checks the executed tool calls each step and, until `query_memory`
has run, holds the model at `toolChoice: 'required'` — it can still call other
tools in any order, but cannot finish with a text-only answer before querying
memory. After `graceSteps` steps (default: 3) without a query, the next step
forces `query_memory` directly, so the loop can never exhaust its budget
without the query having run; `{ graceSteps: 0 }` forces it as the literal
first step. Keep `graceSteps` at least two below your `stopWhen` budget so the
forced query and the final answer both fit.

### Guaranteeing persistence with `ensureMemoryStored()`

`prepareStep` cannot guarantee the *write* side: the loop ends when the model
emits final text, so there is no later step to force `store_memory` into.
`ensureMemoryStored(tools)` is an `onFinish` hook that closes the gap after the
loop instead — if the model never called `store_memory`, it persists the turn
itself:

```ts
const tools = nams.tools({ userId: session.userId });

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model:       openai('gpt-5.4-mini'),
  tools,
  prepareStep: enforceQueryMemory(),      // retrieval guaranteed mid-loop
  onFinish:    ensureMemoryStored(tools), // persistence guaranteed after it
  stopWhen:    stepCountIs(10),
});
```

It returns `{ stored: true, input }` when it wrote, or `{ stored: false, reason }`
where `reason` is `'already-stored'`, `'nothing-to-store'`, or `'failed'` — a
failed write logs and reports rather than throwing into a response that has
already been generated.

By default it stores the assistant's final text as an **`interaction`**
(short-term conversation memory), matching what middleware mode records. It
deliberately does not store it as a `fact`: an agent's summary of what it
remembers is exactly the self-referential input that degrades recall, which is
why the graph extractor skips such entities. Pass `fallback` to decide for
yourself — including returning `null` to store nothing:

```ts
onFinish: ensureMemoryStored(tools, {
  // The onFinish event carries no user message; close over your own prompt.
  fallback: ({ text }) => ({ content: `User: ${prompt}\nAssistant: ${text}`, type: 'interaction' }),
})
```

Pass the tool set object itself, not a copy — `ensureMemoryStored({ ...tools })`
throws immediately, because a spread loses the binding to the memory client.
In provider and middleware mode you need none of this: both directions happen
unconditionally in code.

### Tools Mode with MCP (optional)

Still tools mode — not a separate mode. `toolsWithMcp()` connects to an MCP
server and merges its tools with the NAMS memory tools, so one agent can
remember *and* use external tooling. Requires the optional peer `@ai-sdk/mcp`
(`npm install @ai-sdk/mcp`) — it is loaded lazily, only when an MCP config is
passed.

```ts
import { createNams, enforceQueryMemory } from '@neo4j-labs/nams-ai-provider';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { ToolLoopAgent, stepCountIs } from 'ai';

const nams = createNams({ apiKey: process.env.MEMORY_API_KEY! });

const { tools, close } = await nams.toolsWithMcp(
  { userId: session.userId },
  {
    url:        'https://mcp.example.com/mcp',
    headers:    { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
    toolPrefix: 'mcp_',
  },
);

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model:       openai('gpt-5.4-mini'),
  tools,       // query_memory + store_memory + mcp_* server tools
  prepareStep: enforceQueryMemory(),  // memory queried before answering, MCP tools in any order
  stopWhen:    stepCountIs(10),
});

try {
  const result = await agent.generate({ prompt: 'What did we decide last week?' });
  console.log(result.text);
} finally {
  await close(); // closes the MCP connection (no-op when MCP wasn't configured)
}
```

When the MCP config is omitted, `toolsWithMcp(scope)` behaves exactly like
`tools(scope)` with a no-op `close`.

### Combining tools mode with middleware (hybrid)

Middleware and tools modes are not mutually exclusive — one `createNams`
instance can serve both. The middleware-wrapped model injects baseline memory
context on every call, while the tools let the model run targeted searches and
explicit writes on top. This mirrors the "core memory injected each turn +
memory tool for on-demand search" pattern from the
[AI SDK custom memory tool guide](https://ai-sdk.dev/cookbook/guides/custom-memory-tool):

```ts
const nams  = createNams({ apiKey: process.env.MEMORY_API_KEY! });
const scope = { userId: session.userId };

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model:    nams.wrap(openai('gpt-5.4-mini'), scope), // baseline context injected every call
  tools:    nams.tools(scope),                        // targeted search + explicit writes
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10),
});
```

In this setup, skip `enforceQueryMemory()` — the middleware already guarantees
retrieval unconditionally in code, so forcing `query_memory` as well would
just spend an extra step re-fetching similar context. The enforcement hook is
for pure tools mode, where the tool call is the *only* retrieval path.

---

## Hooks Mode (runtime-controlled) ✅ recommended for production session memory

Tools mode is LLM-controlled: the model decides when to query and store, which
is **not deterministic** — models sometimes skip writes (only part of a turn
gets persisted) or skip reads (the agent forgets earlier turns).
`ensureMemoryStored()` and `enforceQueryMemory()` narrow that gap, but the
transcript is still curated by the model.

Hooks mode removes the model from the loop entirely. Nothing memory-related
appears in the tool schema; instead the runtime restores the transcript before
every generation and persists it after. Every user, assistant, and tool turn
is captured **exactly once per generation**, regardless of what the LLM
decides.

```ts
import { createNams } from '@neo4j-labs/nams-ai-provider';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { ToolLoopAgent, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const nams    = createNams({ apiKey: process.env.MEMORY_API_KEY! });
const session = nams.hooks();   // one instance: loadSession + onFinish share a client

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: openai('gpt-5.4-mini'),
  tools: { /* your domain tools — no memory tools needed */ },

  callOptionsSchema: z.object({
    userId: z.string(),
    conversationId: z.string().optional(),
    prompt: z.string(),
  }),

  // ── PRE hook: restore history + scope onFinish ─────────────────────────────
  // Strip `prompt` / `messages` from the incoming settings — the AI SDK
  // enforces prompt XOR messages, and we're replacing them with the restored
  // transcript.
  prepareCall: async ({ options, prompt: _p, messages: _m, ...settings }) => ({
    ...settings,
    messages: [
      ...(await session.loadSession(options)),
      { role: 'user', content: options!.prompt },
    ],
    // Per-call scope flows to the construction-time onFinish below.
    runtimeContext: options,
  }),

  // ── POST hook: persist every turn exactly once ─────────────────────────────
  onFinish: session.onFinish(),

  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10),
});

// Usage
await agent.generate({
  prompt: 'Hi! My name is Alex.',
  options: { userId: 'alice', prompt: 'Hi! My name is Alex.' },
});
```

**What the hooks do:**

| Hook | Method | When it runs | What it does |
|------|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Pre  | `session.loadSession({ userId, conversationId? })` | Inside `prepareCall`, before every LLM call | Reads prior turns from NAMS, returns `ModelMessage[]` you prepend to `messages`. Never creates a conversation; returns `[]` for a new user or on backend errors. |
| Post | `session.onFinish()` | After the full tool loop finishes | Persists the user prompt plus every assistant and tool turn across all steps, in order, in one bulk write. |

`loadSession()` restores user/assistant turns only. Tool turns are stored in
NAMS as metadata-tagged audit records (searchable, auditable) but are not
replayed as provider tool-result blocks, because OpenAI Responses and
Anthropic Messages reject orphan tool results without the matching prior
assistant tool call.

**Why `runtimeContext`?** `ToolLoopAgent` only accepts `onFinish` at
construction time, but you still need per-call scope (`userId`,
`conversationId`, `prompt`). The hook reads those from the generation's
`runtimeContext`, which you set inside `prepareCall`. With one-shot
`generateText` / `streamText` you can skip the context and bake the scope in
as a closure instead:

```ts
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5.4-mini'),
  messages: [
    ...(await session.loadSession({ userId })),
    { role: 'user', content: prompt },
  ],
  onFinish: session.onFinish({ userId, prompt }),
});
```

When both are present, `runtimeContext` wins per-call and the closure scope
back-fills whatever it omits. Set `persistUserPrompt: false` if your API
handler already stores the user turn itself.

See [`examples/hooks-chat.ts`](examples/hooks-chat.ts) for the full runnable
example, or run it side by side with the other modes via
`NAMS_MODE=hooks npx tsx examples/mode-switch-chat.ts`.

> **Note:** Hooks mode replaces only the *session transcript* half of memory.
> Long-term memory (facts, preferences, patterns, the entity graph) is
> intentionally left to the other modes — it should be selective and
> content-dependent, not every-turn. Combine hooks with `nams.tools(scope)`
> on the same agent for model-driven long-term writes.

---

## Lifecycle Hooks

`loadSession` / `onFinish` cover the transcript. Lifecycle hooks cover
everything around it: gate a prompt, deny a tool call, rewrite tool arguments,
redact a memory write, add context for the next turn. The model will be
familiar from editor hook systems — events, matcher groups, and decision
fields — with plain functions in place of shell commands, so there is no stdin
JSON and no exit codes.

```ts
const session = nams.hooks({
  userId,
  hooks: {
    // A bare function matches every occurrence.
    SessionStart: [({ reason }) => ({ additionalContext: `Session ${reason}.` })],

    // A group adds a matcher: a plain name, `a|b`, or a regex.
    PreToolUse: [{
      matcher: 'delete_account|drop_table',
      hooks: [() => ({
        permissionDecision: 'deny',
        permissionDecisionReason: 'Destructive tools are disabled.',
      })],
    }],

    // Redact before anything reaches the graph.
    PreMemoryWrite: [({ turns }) => ({
      updatedTurns: turns.map(t => ({ ...t, content: redact(t.content) })),
    })],
  },
});
```

### Events

| Event | Fires | Matches on | Can |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----|
| `SessionStart` | First `prepare()` for a scope | `created` \| `resumed` | add context |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | Inside `prepare()`, before history loads | — | **block**, rewrite the prompt, add context |
| `PreToolUse` | Before a wrapped tool runs | tool name | **deny**, rewrite the arguments, add context |
| `PostToolUse` | After the tool returns | tool name | rewrite the result, add context |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | After the tool throws | tool name | ask for one retry, add context |
| `PreMemoryWrite` | Inside `onFinish()`, before saving | — | **block** the write, rewrite the turns |
| `Stop` | After the turn is saved | — | add context |
| `SessionEnd` | `session.end()` | your reason string | add context |

Every handler can also return `systemMessage`, which goes to `onSystemMessage`
or the logger.

### Wiring

| Method | Runs | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `session.prepare({ userId, prompt })` | `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, then `loadSession` | Returns `{ messages, instructions, prompt, blocked, blockReason }`. Check `blocked` before calling the model. |
| `session.withHooks(tools)` | `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure` | Wraps an AI SDK tool set. Returns it untouched when no tool hooks are registered. |
| `session.onFinish()` | `PreMemoryWrite`, then `Stop` | Unchanged otherwise. |
| `session.end({ reason })` | `SessionEnd` | Also forgets the scope, so the next `prepare()` is a new session. |

Hook context reaches the model through `instructions`:

```ts
const prepared = await session.prepare({ userId, prompt });
if (prepared.blocked) return prepared.blockReason;

const { text } = await agent.generate({
  messages: prepared.messages,
  options: { userId, prompt: prepared.prompt, memoryContext: prepared.instructions },
});

// ...and in the agent, prepareCall folds it into the instructions:
prepareCall: ({ options, ...settings }) => ({
  ...settings,
  instructions: [MY_INSTRUCTIONS, options?.memoryContext].filter(Boolean).join('\n\n'),
  runtimeContext: options,
}),
```

### Rules

- **Matchers** omitted or `*` matches everything, plain
  names match exactly, `|` separates alternatives, anything else is a regular
  expression. A bad expression is reported at startup and never matches.
- **Rewrites chain.** Each handler sees the previous handler's replacement, and
  the final value is what the tool, the model, or the write actually gets.
- **The first deny wins** and skips the handlers after it.
- **A hook can never break a generation.** One that throws is logged and
  skipped; one that outruns its timeout, 30 seconds by default, is abandoned.
- **`additionalContext` comes back as `instructions`,** never as a message. The
  AI SDK rejects system messages inside `messages`, so `prepare()` hands you the
  text to append to your own instructions. Context from a tool hook is queued
  for the scope and arrives on the next `prepare()`, capped at the 20 most
  recent entries. Ignore the field and that context is dropped.
- **A denied tool returns `{ blocked: true, toolName, reason }`** to the model
  rather than throwing, so the loop continues and the model can explain itself.
- **`Stop` cannot block.** The generation is already finished when `onFinish`
  runs. Use `UserPromptSubmit` or `PreToolUse` for control.

See [`examples/advanced-hooks-chat.ts`](examples/advanced-hooks-chat.ts) for a
runnable example covering every event.

## Configuration

```ts
createNamsProvider({
  // Required
  apiKey:               string,
  baseProvider:         (modelId: string) => LanguageModelV4,
  scope:                { userId: string, conversationId?: string },

  // Optional
  endpoint?:            string,   // Default: https://memory.neo4jlabs.com/v1
  workspaceId?:         string,
  logger?:              NamsLogger, // warn/error sink for non-fatal errors. Default: console
  maxMemories?:         number,   // Max memories retrieved and injected into the prompt per turn (capped at 12). Default: 6
  persistInteractions?: boolean,  // Save each turn. Default: true
  crossSessionLimit?:   number,   // Other recent conversations each lookup also searches, 2 requests each. 0 = off. Default: 5
  graphExpansionLimit?: number,   // Matched entities whose relationships are read back, 1 request each. 0 = off. Default: 2
});
```

`crossSessionLimit` and `graphExpansionLimit` also apply to `createNams`
(middleware, tools, and hooks modes).

`extractionModel` / `extractionOptions` live on `createNams` and apply to tools
mode only — see [Graph Extraction](#graph-extraction-tools-mode).


### Environment variables

No environment variable selects or changes the mode — provider, middleware,
tools, and hooks modes are chosen entirely in code, and all four read the same
variables:

| Variable | Required | Used for |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `MEMORY_API_KEY` | yes | NAMS API key — pass it as `apiKey` (the examples and snippets read it from the environment) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | yes* | Read by `@ai-sdk/openai`; *swap for whichever `@ai-sdk/*` provider key your base model needs |
| `NAMS_DEMO_USER` | no | Overrides the demo `userId` in the [runnable examples](./examples) |
| `NAMS_DEMO_MODEL` | no | Overrides the demo model id (default: `gpt-5.4-mini`) in the [runnable examples](./examples) |

---

## Graph Extraction (tools mode)

Pass `extractionModel` to build a real Neo4j entity graph from long-term
memories instead of storing flat text:

```ts
const nams = createNams({
  apiKey:          process.env.MEMORY_API_KEY!,
  extractionModel: openai('gpt-5.4-mini'),
});

const tools = nams.tools({ userId });
```

A `store_memory` write of type `fact`, `user_preference`, or `pattern` turns
`"User is named Alex, works at TechCorp"` into `(Alex)-[:WORKS_AT]->(TechCorp)`
instead of one sentence-shaped node.

> **Scope:** tools mode only. Middleware, provider, and hooks mode persist
> turns as short-term messages, which NAMS extracts server-side — extracting

An extracted entity that is already stored under the same name and type is
reused rather than created again, so every memory about "Alex" adds its edges
to the same Alex node. Hosted NAMS has no lookup-by-name route, so the match is
made through entity search; because that search is nearest-neighbour, only an
exact name or canonical name is treated as the same entity, and "Alexandra"
stays a separate node.

Extraction skips **self-referential** entities: when the agent answers "what do
you remember about me?" and stores its own answer, extraction would otherwise
mint entities *about remembering* (`long-term memories [Concept]`,
`profile details [Object]`). Those meta-entities are the closest match for the
next such question, so they outrank the real facts and every ask degrades the
next one. Skipped entities are logged at `warn`.

```ts
extractionOptions: {
  // "preferences" is a real entity here; drop raw identifiers instead.
  skipEntity: (e) => /^[a-z0-9_]+$/.test(e.name),
}
```

## Memory Sources

NAMS searches four sources in parallel, once per turn, then expands the
entities that matched into a fifth. In middleware and provider modes, later
steps of a tool loop reuse the turn's memories instead of searching again.

| Source | What it stores |
|--------|---------------|
| Long-term graph | Facts, preferences, patterns (Neo4j entities) |
| Graph | The relationships around the entities that matched — see below |
| Current conversation | Messages in the active session |
| Cross-session | Messages from the user's 5 most recent other conversations (`crossSessionLimit`) |
| Reasoning traces | Prior step-by-step reasoning from agent runs |

NAMS uses vector search where the workspace has embeddings, and a text match
otherwise. For a text match, a question that finds nothing is retried with its
longest words.

The sources are merged by **taking turns**, not by concatenating: with
`maxMemories: 6`, five entity matches cannot fill the prompt and leave one slot
for everything else. Each source keeps the order the backend returned it in.

### Graph Retrieval

This is the part a vector memory cannot do. Entity search returns entities
without their edges, so after the search the top matches are expanded — one
request each — and their stored relationships are added to the prompt as
triples:

```
Relevant long-term memory about this user (use it to personalise your answer):
1. [long-term] Alex — The user
2. [graph] (Alex)-[WORKS_AT]->(TechCorp)
3. [graph] (Alex)-[USES]->(Neovim)
4. [conversation] I need something that runs in the terminal
A [graph] line is a stored relationship, written (subject)-[RELATIONSHIP]->(object).
```

The model is told what the notation means only when a triple is actually
present. In tools mode the same triples come back from `query_memory` as hits
with `source: 'graph'`.

So a question like *"who else works where I work?"* is answerable from one
turn's context: the edge is in the prompt, not left sitting in the database
behind a similarity score.

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `graphExpansionLimit: 2` | Default. The two best entity matches are expanded. |
| `graphExpansionLimit: 0` | No graph reads. Entities stay flat text. |
| `graphExpansionLimit: 4` | Wider graph context, at four extra requests per turn. |

At most five relationships are taken from any one entity, so a hub node cannot
crowd out the rest of the prompt. An edge whose target has no stored name is
dropped rather than shown as a bare id, and an entity that cannot be read is
logged and skipped — the other sources still answer.

## Development

```bash
npm install        # install dev dependencies
npm test           # run the vitest suite (provider, middleware, tools, hooks)
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm run build      # tsup → dist/
```

> **Note on conversation caching:** each provider / tools instance keeps its own
> conversation-id cache (scoped per `MemoryClient`). Create one instance per user
> session; instances never share cached conversation ids.
