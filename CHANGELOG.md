## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- **Strands MemoryStore** (`Neo4jMemoryStore`) — cross-session recall for Strands
  agents via `MemoryManager(stores=[...])`: long-term search, plus writes that feed
  server-side extraction. Entities only on NAMS. Needs `strands.memory`, added in
  `strands-agents` 1.44 — the `[strands]` extra floors at 1.52, so it is always there.
  `get_tools()` adds `{name}_get_entity_graph` (multi-hop bolt, 1-hop NAMS) and, bolt-only with a configured user_id, the user-scoped `{name}_get_user_preferences`.
  A store built from `settings=` owns its client and rebinds it when the event
  loop changes (Strands' synchronous `Agent(...)` runs every call on a fresh
  loop); a client passed as `client=` is never closed or reconnected, and a
  loop change raises a named error instead of an opaque driver `RuntimeError`.
  With a `user_id` set, preference recall is scoped to that user in both the
  store and `Neo4jSessionManager` injection (`search_preferences` applies no
  user filter, so an unscoped call could surface another tenant's
  preferences).
  Tool names are prefixed with the store's `name` so they coexist with
  `context_graph_tools`' identically-named tools rather than silently
  replacing them in the agent's registry, and `max_search_results` caps the
  *total* rows per `search()` — shared across entities, preferences and facts
  so no kind is crowded out.
- **Strands SessionManager** (`Neo4jSessionManager`) — automatic conversation
  persistence/restore for AWS Strands agents via `Agent(session_manager=...)`,
  backed by any `MemoryClient` (bolt or NAMS). Includes opt-in long-term
  memory injection (`Neo4jRetrievalConfig`), a write-behind buffer for
  guardrail redaction, optional tool-call mirroring into reasoning memory
  (`record_tool_calls=True`), and `Neo4jSessionManager.for_nams()` for the
  hosted service.
- **Ontology `import` / `diff` / `migrate` on `client.ontology`.** Closes the gap
  where these shipped server-side + REST but weren't reachable from the SDK.
  `import_(content=/url=, format=)` converts an external graph/ontology document
  (Arrows / Neo4j Data Importer / RDF / GraphQL / Cypher / LinkML / native) into a
  non-persisted draft; `diff(id, from_revision, to_revision)` returns a structural
  diff; `migrate(id, ...)` enqueues an async label-rename job and `get_migration(job_id)`
  polls it. New models: `OntologyImportResult`, `ImportWarning`, `OntologyDiff`,
  `MigrationJob`. Mirrored in the TypeScript SDK (`OntologyClient.import/diff/migrate/getMigration`).
- **`client.auth` — API-key management (NAMS).** New Python accessor mirroring the
  TypeScript `AuthClient`: `list_api_keys`, `create_api_key`, `reveal_api_key`,
  `rotate_api_key`, `revoke_api_key`, and `refresh_access_token`, with `ApiKey` /
  `AccessTokenPair` models. On bolt it is a `NotSupportedError` sentinel. Also adds
  `rotateApiKey` to the TypeScript `AuthClient` (was missing).
- **`short_term.get_extraction_status(...)`** — the authoritative per-conversation
  extraction rollup (`ExtractionStatus` with `is_complete` / `pending_count`),
  backed by `GET /v1/conversations/{id}/extraction-status`.
- **`long_term.expand_graph(node_id, loaded_ids=...)`** — 1-hop entity-neighborhood
  expansion (`POST /v1/graph/expand`) for graph visualization; mirrored in the
  TypeScript SDK as `longTerm.expandGraph(nodeId, loadedIds)`.
- **`Neo4jClient.session()`** — public accessor returning a new driver session for
  raw Cypher access (session-level control the `execute_read`/`execute_write`
  helpers don't offer, e.g. streaming GDS algorithm results). Thin wrapper over the
  existing private `_get_session()`.
- **The self-hosted (bolt) memory classes now implement the full memory
  Protocols.** `ShortTermMemory` gains the Gold-tier conversation-lifecycle
  methods `create_conversation()`, `list_conversations()`, and `bulk_add_messages()`
  (real, graph-backed — `bulk_add_messages` delegates to the existing
  `add_messages_batch`). The Platinum-tier NAMS features that have no self-hosted
  semantics — `ShortTermMemory.get_observations()` / `get_reflections()` and
  `LongTermMemory.set_entity_feedback()` / `get_entity_history()` — are now present
  and raise `NotSupportedError(backend="bolt", …)` with a workaround hint (previously
  they raised `AttributeError`). This lets `client.short_term` / `client.long_term`
  type-check without per-call-site `attr-defined` suppressions.

### Fixed

- **Enrichment results now reach `entity.metadata`.** `LongTermMemory._parse_entity`
  dropped every field background enrichment had written, so
  `entity.metadata["enriched_description"]` / `["wikipedia_url"]` /
  `["wikidata_id"]` / `["image_url"]` / `["enriched_at"]` were always missing even
  after a successful enrichment (CLAUDE.md implementation note 22 promised
  attributes no code path produced). The node properties and the
  `enrichment_data` JSON blob are now folded back into `Entity.metadata`, using the
  same names as `EnrichmentResult.to_entity_attributes()`. Relatedly,
  `BackgroundEnrichmentService._update_entity` now also writes `e.wikipedia_url`,
  `e.wikidata_id` and `e.image_url` as node properties — `MemoryClient.get_locations`
  already selected `e.wikipedia_url` and could only ever return `None` for it.
- **`ExactMatchResolver` no longer reports `match_type="exact"` when nothing
  matched.** Both non-matching paths (no candidates supplied, and no candidate
  equal to the name) now return `match_type="none"`, matching `CompositeResolver`.
  The field was previously unreadable for this resolver: callers had to re-compare
  names to tell a hit from a miss.
- **`LongTermProtocol.wait_for_extraction()` accepts the readiness arguments its
  implementations do.** The Protocol declared a no-argument method while the NAMS
  implementation takes `session_id` / `conversation_id` / `query` /
  `expected_names` / `min_results` / `predicate` / `timeout` / `interval`, so
  portable code calling it through `client.long_term` failed `mypy --strict`. All
  parameters are keyword-only and optional; bolt still returns `True` immediately.
- **Entity aliases are now readable by alias.** `add_entity` wrote `aliases`
  into the JSON `metadata` blob while `get_entity_by_name` looks for a top-level
  `aliases` property, so an entity was never findable by an alias passed to
  `add_entity`. `aliases` is now a top-level list property everywhere, matching
  what `MERGE_ENTITIES` already wrote; rows written earlier still read back via
  the `metadata` fallback.
- **`add_relationship` no longer acknowledges a write that matched nothing.**
  The query `MATCH`es both endpoints before `MERGE`ing the edge, so ids that
  address no node wrote zero rows and returned a relationship the graph did not
  contain. It now raises `NotFoundError` naming both ids, and on a re-add it
  returns the stored id instead of a newly minted one.
- **`add_entity` returns the id the graph stored.** The `MERGE` is keyed on
  `(name, type)`, so a repeat add hits `ON MATCH`, keeps the original `id` and
  discards the freshly minted one — the returned entity then addressed no node,
  and every later write keyed on it (`add_relationship`,
  `link_entity_to_message`) silently did nothing.
- **`merge_duplicate_entities` no longer orphans edges.** It migrated only
  `MENTIONS` and `SAME_AS`, so a merge dropped the entity's `RELATED_TO` edges
  (both directions) and both provenance edges (`EXTRACTED_FROM`,
  `EXTRACTED_BY`), plus the v0.2 `APPLIES_TO` and `TOUCHED` audit edges. All of
  them are now copied onto the surviving entity and tagged `migrated_from`; the
  merged-away entity keeps its own edges so the merge stays reversible.
- **`add_messages_batch` now accepts `user_identifier`**, enforcing `multi_tenant`
  and linking the conversation to its `:User`; previously the bulk path silently
  wrote unscoped, unlinked conversations — so a bulk write that used to succeed
  now raises `ValueError` when `multi_tenant=True` and `user_identifier` is omitted.

### Changed

- **`[mcp]` extra moves to `fastmcp>=4.0,<5`** (was `>=2.0.0,<3`), which brings MCP
  Python SDK 2 (`mcp>=2`, `mcp-types`). The self-hosted MCP server was migrated to
  the FastMCP 4 API; tools, resources, prompts and both profiles are unchanged on
  the wire.
  - **Streamable HTTP replaces HTTP+SSE for networked deployments.**
    `mcp serve --transport http` (or the explicit `streamable-http`) serves the
    single `POST`/`GET` endpoint at `/mcp/`. `--transport sse` is kept as a
    **deprecated alias** so existing launch configurations keep starting: it logs a
    warning and serves Streamable HTTP rather than the retired transport. Client
    URLs must change from `/sse` + `/messages` to `/mcp/`.
    `run_server(transport=...)` accepts all four names through the new
    `mcp.server.normalize_transport()`; `Neo4jMemoryMCPServer.run_sse()` is a
    deprecated shim for the new `run_http()`.
  - `deploy/cloudrun` now launches with `--transport http --host 0.0.0.0`, and its
    `service.yaml` probes the listening socket instead of a `/health` route that the
    server never served (an `httpGet` startup probe could not pass).
  - Lifespan access moved to FastMCP 4's `Context.lifespan_context` (it reads the
    owning server's lifespan result, which stays correct when this server is mounted
    under another one) instead of `ctx.request_context.lifespan_context`.
  - Tool annotations key on the MCP SDK 2 field names (`read_only_hint`,
    `destructive_hint`, `idempotent_hint`). FastMCP still bridges the legacy
    camelCase spelling through a shim that can be switched off, so the native names
    keep the hints working either way.
  - The FastMCP startup banner is suppressed on `stdio`, where the MCP host owns
    stderr and the banner is only noise in its logs.
  - `pydantic-ai` stays on the `-slim` distribution, but no longer for collision
    reasons: `fastmcp` 4 is itself a wrapper over `fastmcp-slim` 4.x, so the two
    extras now resolve to the same distribution and the suffix is purely about
    install weight. Installing `[mcp]` alongside `[pydantic-ai]` is supported.
  - NAMS is unaffected: `mcp` 2 pulls `httpx2`, a separately-named distribution, so
    the NAMS transport keeps resolving `httpx` 0.28.

- **`[strands]` extra floors at `strands-agents>=1.52,<2`** (was `>=1.44.0`,
  itself up from `>=0.1.0`). 1.52 is the oldest release carrying every surface the
  two adapters bind to: the `SessionManager` base class with its multi-agent *and*
  bidirectional hooks, and the `strands.memory` package (`MemoryStore`,
  `MemoryManager`, `AddMessagesContext`, `ExtractionConfig`) that `Neo4jMemoryStore`
  implements. Re-verified against 1.55.1, which the lock now resolves; both
  adapters are unchanged in behaviour. Documented limitation sharpened: attaching
  `Neo4jSessionManager` to a Strands Graph/Swarm or a `BidiAgent` raises
  `NotImplementedError` from the base class (naming the adapter), so those
  topologies want one of Strands' own repository-backed managers.
- **Bedrock model ids in `integrations.strands.config` refreshed to
  inference-profile ids, and made resolvable from the environment.**
  `BEDROCK_LLM_MODELS` carried `anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0`,
  `anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0` and `anthropic.claude-3-opus-20240229-v1:0`
  — two retired generations and three bare foundation-model ids, which current
  Claude models on Bedrock cannot be invoked by. Values are now
  `<prefix>.anthropic.…` cross-region inference-profile ids (default prefix `us`),
  derived from the new `BEDROCK_CLAUDE_BASE_MODELS` map. New resolvers
  `bedrock_llm_model(alias)` / `bedrock_embedding_model(alias)` honour
  `BEDROCK_MODEL_ID`, `BEDROCK_INFERENCE_PROFILE_PREFIX` and
  `BEDROCK_EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID` so a deployment can pin an id without a release.
  Dict keys are unchanged. `BEDROCK_EMBEDDING_MODELS` is unchanged on purpose: it
  lists only the payload shapes `BedrockEmbedder` can build (Titan text, Cohere
  embed v3), so Nova multimodal embedding ids are deliberately absent.
- **LangChain integration moved to the 1.x line** (BREAKING for the extra). The
  `[langchain]` extra now installs `langchain-core>=1.0,<2` (was
  `langchain-core>=0.2.0`, a floor spanning the whole v0→v1 migration), and a new
  `[langchain-agents]` extra adds `langchain>=1.0,<2` for the agent middleware.
  What changed, and why:

  - **`Neo4jAgentMemory` now implements `langchain_core.chat_history.BaseChatMessageHistory`.**
    It previously imitated the pre-v1 `BaseMemory` protocol (`memory_variables` /
    `load_memory_variables` / `save_context`) while subclassing nothing —
    and `langchain_core.memory` does not exist in 1.x, so the shape it mimicked
    was not pluggable into anything. It is now a real chat history: `aget_messages()`,
    `aadd_messages()`, `aclear()` (plus the sync twins), so it drops straight into
    `RunnableWithMessageHistory` and into a classic `ConversationBufferMemory(chat_memory=…)`.
    The context-assembly surface is kept, with public async names:
    **`aload_memory_variables()` / `asave_context()`** replace
    `_load_memory_variables_async()` / `_save_context_async()`, which remain as
    aliases for one release. New `session_id`-scoped `extract_entities` /
    `generate_embeddings` constructor options. The class is no longer a
    `pydantic.BaseModel`; it takes the same keyword arguments.
  - **`Neo4jMemoryRetriever` implements the async hook LangChain actually calls.**
    Its coroutine was named `_get_relevant_documents_async`, which
    `BaseRetriever.__init_subclass__` never sees: LangChain synthesised an
    `_aget_relevant_documents` that ran the *sync* path in a worker thread, so
    `await retriever.ainvoke(...)` called `asyncio.run()` on a fresh loop against
    a Neo4j driver bound to the caller's loop. The hook is now
    `_aget_relevant_documents` and `ainvoke` runs on the caller's loop. New
    `session_id=` field, threaded into `short_term.search_messages` (required on
    NAMS, whose message search is conversation-scoped). `_get_relevant_documents_async`
    remains as an alias for one release.
  - **New `Neo4jMemoryMiddleware`** — a `langchain.agents.middleware.AgentMiddleware`
    for `create_agent`. `abefore_model` persists new user turns, `awrap_model_call`
    appends `client.get_context(...)` to the request's system message (leaving agent
    state untouched, the way `TodoListMiddleware` does), and `aafter_model` persists
    the reply, de-duplicated by message id so a tool loop does not re-store the same
    history. Only the async hooks are implemented; the sync hooks raise
    `NotImplementedError` naming `ainvoke` rather than silently skipping memory.
    Requires `[langchain-agents]`; omitted from the package's exports when the
    `langchain` distribution is absent.
  - **Both adapters are NAMS-tolerant.** `search_preferences` and
    `get_similar_traces` are bolt-only and raise `NotSupportedError` on the hosted
    backend; they now degrade to `[]` / `""` / a skipped retrieval layer instead of
    failing the call, and `long_term.get_context` returning `""` on NAMS falls back
    to `long_term.search_entities`. Previously `Neo4jAgentMemory` had to be
    constructed with `include_long_term=False, include_reasoning=False` on NAMS.
  - **The sync surfaces no longer deadlock.** `Neo4jAgentMemory` used to schedule a
    coroutine onto the caller's *running* loop and then block on the result, and the
    retriever ran `asyncio.run()` in a worker thread against a loop-bound driver.
    Both now raise a `RuntimeError` naming the coroutine to await when called from
    inside a running event loop.

  `how-to/integrations/langchain.adoc` is rewritten against 1.x (`create_agent` +
  middleware, `RunnableWithMessageHistory`, the retriever, async `@tool` functions,
  a reasoning-trace middleware) and carries a table mapping the retired
  `ConversationChain` / `AgentExecutor` / `ConversationBufferMemory` imports to their
  `langchain_classic` locations.

- **Microsoft Agent Framework integration moved to the 1.x GA line** (BREAKING
  for the extra). The `[microsoft-agent]` extra now installs
  `agent-framework-core>=1.13,<2` (was `agent-framework>=1.0.0b260212`, the
  public-preview pin). The GA line removed exactly the two base classes the
  adapter extended, so the old pin no longer imported at all:
  `Neo4jContextProvider` now subclasses `agent_framework.ContextProvider`
  (was `BaseContextProvider`) and `Neo4jChatMessageStore` subclasses
  `agent_framework.HistoryProvider` (was `BaseHistoryProvider`). The
  keyword-only `before_run(*, agent, session, context, state)` /
  `after_run(...)` hook signatures are unchanged, so no caller code changes —
  `chat_client.as_agent(context_providers=[provider])` works as before.
  `Neo4jChatMessageStore.get_messages()` / `save_messages()` now declare the
  GA keyword-only `state` parameter that `HistoryProvider` passes them.
  `MICROSOFT_AGENT_FRAMEWORK_VERSION` is `1.18.0` and
  `MICROSOFT_AGENT_FRAMEWORK_MIN_VERSION` is `1.13.0`.

  The extra deliberately requires `agent-framework-core` rather than the
  `agent-framework` meta-package: at GA the meta-package resolves to
  `agent-framework-core[all]`, pulling ~30 provider distributions (anthropic,
  bedrock, gemini, mistral, ollama, redis, devui's fastapi/uvicorn, powerfx, …)
  that this adapter never imports. Everything it does import is exported from
  the top-level `agent_framework` package that `-core` ships. Install your chat
  client alongside it (`agent-framework-openai`, `agent-framework-azure-ai`, or
  the `agent-framework` meta-package).

  New tests cover the contract that silently broke: the adapters are asserted to
  subclass the GA base classes, the hook signatures are compared against the
  framework's own, and three integration tests drive a real `Agent` run loop
  over a fake chat client (previously every test called `before_run` /
  `after_run` by hand, so nothing noticed the providers no longer loaded).
- **Google ADK integration moved to google-adk 2.x** (BREAKING for the extra).
  The `[google-adk]` extra now installs `google-adk>=2.0,<3` plus
  `google-genai>=1.0` (was `google-adk>=0.1.0`, which resolved to the 1.1.1
  preview era); the "Google ADK is in preview" warning on `Neo4jMemoryService`
  is gone, and the lock also moves OpenTelemetry to 1.42.1 / semconv 0.63b1
  because `google.adk.runners` imports semantic-convention attributes that
  0.60b1 does not ship. `Neo4jMemoryService` now implements the full 2.x
  `BaseMemoryService` contract and really subclasses it, so `Runner` and `App`
  accept it: `search_memory()` takes ADK's keyword call (`app_name=`,
  `user_id=`, `query=`; `query` stays positional for 0.5.0 callers) and returns
  a `SearchMemoryResponse` of ADK `MemoryEntry` objects whose `content` is a
  `google.genai.types.Content` — with `author`, ISO-8601 `timestamp`, `id` and
  `custom_metadata` (`memory_type`, `score`) populated, which is what
  `load_memory` / `preload_memory` render. The 2.x write paths
  `add_events_to_memory(...)` (incremental event deltas) and
  `add_memory(app_name=, user_id=, memories=[MemoryEntry(...)])` are
  implemented; the 0.5.0 convenience form `add_memory(content=...,
  memory_type=...)` is unchanged and still returns the library's own
  `MemoryEntry`.
- **Fixed: ADK agent turns were silently dropped on write.** ADK authors model
  events with the *agent name* (`memory_demo`, `supervisor`, …), which the
  adapter passed straight into `short_term.add_message(role=...)`, where it
  failed `MessageRole` validation — and the per-message `except Exception:
  logger.warning` hid it, so a real `Runner` session stored only its user
  turns. Authors are now mapped to `MessageRole` (unknown author → `assistant`,
  original kept as `adk_author` in the message metadata and re-attributed on
  search), and write failures are logged at error level with a failure count.
- **PydanticAI integration moved to PydanticAI 2.x** (BREAKING for the extra).
  The `[pydantic-ai]` extra now installs `pydantic-ai-slim[openai]>=2.0,<3`
  (was `pydantic-ai>=0.1.0`) — the same `pydantic_ai` import package as the
  meta-package, minus the ~20 provider SDKs the adapter never imports. (The
  original reason was a file collision between the meta-package's
  `pydantic-ai-slim[mcp]` → `fastmcp-slim>=3` and the `fastmcp<3` distribution
  behind `[mcp]`; that is moot now that `[mcp]` is on `fastmcp` 4, which itself
  wraps `fastmcp-slim` 4.x. The two extras can be installed together.)
  `record_agent_trace` now reads `AgentRunResult.output` (`.data` was removed
  in PydanticAI 1.0, so the recorded outcome was silently always
  `"Completed"`), records the model name from `result.response.model_name`,
  and completes the trace with a `TraceOutcome` whose `metrics` carry the run
  usage (`input_tokens` / `output_tokens` / `requests` / `tool_calls`) from the
  `result.usage` property. `create_memory_tools` still returns plain callables
  — valid `Agent(tools=...)` members on 2.x — and the docstrings now show the
  2.x idioms (`@agent.instructions` with `ctx.prompt`, model instances,
  `FunctionToolset` for `toolsets=`). `how-to/integrations/pydantic-ai.adoc`
  was swept for `result_type=` → `output_type=`, `result.data` →
  `result.output`, `system_prompt` → `instructions`, `OpenAIModel` →
  `OpenAIChatModel`, `GeminiModel` → `GoogleModel`, and states the supported
  range.
- **Vertex AI embeddings default to `gemini-embedding-001`** (BREAKING).
  `text-embedding-004` (shut down by Google on 2026-01-14) and the
  `textembedding-gecko*` family (shut down 2025-04-09) are now rejected with an
  `EmbeddingError` that names the replacement, instead of failing at request
  time. Supported ids: `gemini-embedding-001` (default), `text-embedding-005`,
  `text-multilingual-embedding-002` — see the new
  `neo4j_agent_memory.embeddings.vertex_models` tables.
  `VertexAIEmbedder` gains `output_dimensionality`, defaulting to **768** even
  though `gemini-embedding-001` emits 3072 natively: Neo4j vector index
  dimensionality is fixed at creation time and `MemoryClient` sizes its indexes
  from `embedder.dimensions`, so the default keeps existing databases working
  with no re-embedding. Pass `output_dimensionality=None` (3072) or `1536` on a
  fresh database for better retrieval quality. `EmbeddingConfig` gains a
  matching `output_dimensionality` field and, when `provider=VERTEX_AI` with no
  explicit `model`, defaults to `gemini-embedding-001`/768.
  `embed_batch` now respects a per-model request cap (`gemini-embedding-001`
  accepts one text per request; the other two accept 250), and the embedder
  falls back to the `google-genai` client when `vertexai.language_models` is
  absent (removed in `google-cloud-aiplatform` 2.x) — the legacy 1.x path is
  unchanged otherwise.
- **The remaining provider and framework extras now floor at the current major**
  (BREAKING for the extras; no API change in this library apart from the Anthropic
  note below). New ranges, each verified against the newest release it admits:
  `neo4j>=5.20,<7` (core dependency — floor unchanged, cap added; resolves 6.3),
  `[openai]` / `[openai-agents]` `openai>=2.0,<4` (was `>=1.0.0`),
  `[anthropic]` `anthropic>=1.0,<2` (was `>=0.20.0`),
  `[sentence-transformers]` `sentence-transformers>=3.0,<7` (was `>=2.2.0`),
  `[vertex-ai]` / `[google]` `google-cloud-aiplatform>=2.0,<3` plus an explicit
  `google-genai>=1.66` (was `>=1.38.0`), `[crewai]` `crewai>=1.0,<2` (was `>=0.50.0`),
  `[llamaindex]` `llama-index-core>=0.14,<1` (was `>=0.10.0`),
  `[instructor]` `instructor>=1.7,<2` and `[litellm]` `litellm>=1.50,<2` (caps
  normalized). Notes:
  - **Anthropic 1.x dropped `temperature` / `top_p` / `top_k` from
    `messages.create()`** — passing one is a `TypeError`, mirroring the API, which
    rejects sampling parameters on current Claude models. `AnthropicProvider` still
    accepts `temperature` (it is part of the provider protocol) but no longer sends
    it, and logs once when a non-default value is discarded; use Anthropic's
    `output_config.effort` instead. Prompt caching, forced-tool-use structured
    extraction, usage translation and error mapping are unchanged. anthropic 1.x is
    also built on `httpx2`, like `mcp` 2 — the NAMS transport keeps resolving `httpx`.
  - **openai 3.x likewise ships on `httpx2` and no longer installs `httpx`.** Both
    majors were exercised end-to-end against a mock transport (chat, strict-mode
    structured output, embeddings with `dimensions=`), and `httpx` 0.28 + `httpx2`
    2.12 coexist in one process. The lock still resolves openai 2.x because litellm
    and crewai both cap it at `<3`; the range is what lets an application without
    those extras run openai 3.
  - `[openai-agents]` deliberately keeps carrying only the `openai` SDK: the adapter
    never imports the `agents` package, and pulling `openai-agents` in would force
    `openai>=3` and make `[all]` unresolvable.
  - **sentence-transformers 6.0 renamed `get_sentence_embedding_dimension()` to
    `get_embedding_dimension()`.** `SentenceTransformerEmbedder` now probes for both,
    so nothing emits a deprecation warning on 6.x while the 3.x-5.x floor still
    works. `encode(texts, convert_to_numpy=True)` is unchanged.
  - Lock consequences worth knowing: sentence-transformers 6 pulls `transformers` 5.x
    and `huggingface-hub` 1.x (GLiNER and spaCy extraction re-verified on both), and
    the lock holds `crewai` at 1.6.1 — the 1.15.x dev line conflicts with
    `fastmcp>=4`. The CrewAI test guards still imported `from crewai.memory import
    Memory`, the path removed in 1.x, so every CrewAI test silently skipped; they now
    probe `crewai.memory.memory` like the adapter and actually run.
- **`Neo4jSessionManager` now guards against a paired `Neo4jMemoryStore` duplicating its work**: raises if both would extract the same turns (always, on NAMS), warns once if both would inject context.
- `ShortTermProtocol.bulk_add_messages` takes explicit keyword-only params
  (`generate_embeddings`, `extract_entities`, `extract_relations`, `user_identifier`)
  instead of `**kwargs`.
- **`MemoryClient` is now generic over its backend memory types**
  (`MemoryClient[ST, LT, RT]`, PEP 696 defaults). `client.short_term` /
  `.long_term` / `.reasoning` return the base `ShortTermProtocol` /
  `LongTermProtocol` / `ReasoningProtocol` (the backend-agnostic contract) by
  default. **Public-API typing change** (runtime unchanged): for bolt-only
  methods (geospatial, geocoding, dedup, provenance, tool-usage stats,
  `add_messages_batch`, `extract_entities_from_session`) obtain a bolt-typed
  client — `await connect(BoltSettings(...))` → `BoltMemoryClient`, or
  `connect(NamsSettings(...))` → `NamsMemoryClient`. `connect()` returns an
  already-connected client (call `await client.close()`; not a context
  manager); `async with MemoryClient(settings)` is unchanged. New exports:
  `connect`, `BoltMemoryClient`, `NamsMemoryClient`, `BoltSettings`,
  `NamsSettings`.
- **NAMS honors a subset of the agnostic surface.** `add_message(metadata=)`
  and `add_entity(subtype=/aliases=/metadata=)` are not persisted on NAMS;
  `extract_entities=` / `generate_embedding=` are no-ops there (done
  server-side). `supersede_preference` and `get_entity_relationships` are not
  on the base Protocol (backend contracts diverge); `add_fact`'s third
  parameter is `obj`, `get_similar_traces` takes `task`.
- **`ToolCallStatus` moved to `core.memory`** (re-exported from
  `memory.reasoning`; no import break); added `typing-extensions>=4.4` runtime
  dependency (PEP 696 defaults).
- **Type safety: the Python SDK is now `mypy --strict` + `ty` clean and enforced in
  CI.** Both checkers run as blocking CI steps (and via `make check` / `make
  pre-commit`) over `src/`, `benchmarks/`, and the `examples/*.py` demos, kept at zero
  errors/diagnostics. Adds the strictness flags `warn_unreachable`,
  `warn_redundant_casts`, `warn_unused_ignores`, and `extra_checks`; makes all nine
  framework integrations checker-clean (`integrations/base.run_sync` is now
  `ParamSpec`-generic); reduces `# type: ignore` to a fully coded-and-justified
  minimum; and removes statically-unreachable dead branches (no runtime effect).
  Contributor typing conventions are documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Runtime bug
  fixes and public-API typing changes surfaced by this work are listed individually
  below.
- **Fixed: Microsoft Agent GDS integration never used the GDS library.**
  `GDSIntegration` called `self._client._client.session()`, but `Neo4jClient` has no
  `session()` method — so every algorithm query raised `AttributeError`, was swallowed
  by the surrounding `try/except`, and silently fell back to basic Cypher even when
  GDS was installed. The unit-test mock had drifted to expose a `.session` attribute
  the real object lacked, masking the bug. Fixed by adding `Neo4jClient.session()` and
  routing GDS through it.
- **Fixed: `context_graph_tools()` (AWS Strands) raised `ValidationError` at runtime.**
  It built `Neo4jConfig(user=..., password=<str>)`, but the field is `username` and
  `password` is a `SecretStr`, with `extra="forbid"` — so every client cache-miss
  raised. Now `username=...` + `password=SecretStr(...)`.
- **Fixed: `Neo4jCrewMemory` (CrewAI) never subclassed the real base class.** The
  import `from crewai.memory import Memory` raised `ImportError` (the class lives at
  `crewai.memory.memory.Memory`), so the class silently fell back to the
  `except ImportError` stub even when CrewAI was installed. Fixed the import.
- **`transport_mode` narrowed to `Literal["auto", "rest", "bridge"]`** on the Strands
  `nams_context_graph_tools()` public function (was `str`), matching
  `NamsConfig.transport_mode` and the documented values. **Public-API typing
  change** — downstream callers passing an unconstrained `str` variable will see a
  type-checker error; the runtime contract is unchanged.
- **`GDSIntegration.find_shortest_path()` return type corrected** from
  `list[dict[str, Any]] | None` to `dict[str, Any] | None` — the annotation was a lie
  (the method has always returned a `{"nodes": ..., "relationships": ...}` dict).
  **Public-API typing change.**
- **Fixed: `neo4j-agent-memory schemas show` crashed with `AttributeError`.** The
  command called `EntitySchemaConfig.to_dict()`, which does not exist on the
  Pydantic v2 model — so every `schemas show` invocation raised before producing
  JSON or YAML output. Now uses `model_dump()`.
- **`ReasoningMemory.add_step()` / `complete_trace()` accept `trace_id: UUID | str`.**
  Both are `str(trace_id)`-normalized internally for the Cypher match, so the strict
  `UUID`-only parameter was widened to `UUID | str` for parity with the sibling id
  parameters (`link_trace_to_message`, `record_tool_call`, `start_trace`'s
  `triggered_by_message_id`). This lets the MCP `memory_record_step` /
  `memory_complete_trace` tools forward the caller-supplied id directly instead of
  requiring UUID-formatted ids. Backward compatible (a `UUID` is still accepted).
- **Fixed: `MemoryIntegration.add_fact()` parses `valid_from` / `valid_until`.**
  These public parameters accept ISO date strings but were forwarded as `str`
  straight into `LongTermMemory.add_fact`, which expects `datetime | None` — a
  silent type mismatch. They are now parsed
  with `datetime.fromisoformat()` (a malformed string now raises `ValueError` at
  the call site instead of corrupting the stored value).
- **Fixed: `LongTermMemory.add()` now returns `Entity`** (per its `BaseMemory[Entity]`
  contract) instead of a `tuple[Entity, DeduplicationResult]`. The tuple return was a
  latent contract violation; no in-tree caller
  destructured it. Use `add_entity(...)` (unchanged) if you need the
  `(Entity, DeduplicationResult)` pair.
- **Memory timestamps are now timezone-aware (UTC).** All default timestamps in the
  library — the `memory/` layer (`Conversation.created_at`,
  `ConversationSummary.generated_at`, `ReasoningTrace.started_at`), the base
  `core.MemoryEntry.created_at` (inherited by `Entity`, `Preference`, `Fact`, and
  every other memory model), `EnrichmentResult.retrieved_at` /
  `EnrichmentTask.created_at`, and the `_to_python_datetime` fallbacks — switched from
  naive `datetime.utcnow()` to `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`. Reads already produced
  aware datetimes; the write side is now consistent.
- **BREAKING: `InstructorProvider.__init__` no longer accepts `async_client`.**
  The parameter (default `True`) was removed.
  `async_client=False` produced a synchronous `instructor.Instructor`, which
  crashed at call time because the provider always `await`s `self._client.create(...)`
  — the sync path never worked. The provider is now unconditionally async. Callers
  that explicitly passed `async_client=True` (the working default) must drop the
  argument; `async_client=False` was already non-functional.
- **`long_term.wait_for_extraction(...)` now uses the authoritative extraction-status
  endpoint** when a `session_id` / `conversation_id` is supplied (polls until no
  message is pending), instead of only the workspace-scoped entity-search heuristic.
  When entity-level assertions (`expected_names` / `predicate` / `query`) are also
  given, it waits for the conversation to finish *then* confirms via search. Fully
  backward-compatible: the search-only path is unchanged when no conversation id is
  passed.
- **`LongTermMemory.get_entity_provenance()` first parameter is now
  `entity_id: Entity | UUID | str`** (was `entity: Entity | UUID`, positional).
  The runtime already accepted an id string (it does `entity.id if isinstance(…,
  Entity) else …`); only the annotation was too narrow. **Public-API typing change** — the
  parameter was renamed `entity` → `entity_id` (all in-tree callers pass it
  positionally); code using the `entity=` keyword must switch to `entity_id=`.

### Fixed

- **NAMS `add_entity` no longer raises `ValidationError` when the server
  auto-merges the create onto an existing entity.** NAMS resolves-before-create:
  a sufficiently similar name responds `{id, resolution: "merged", merged_into,
  confidence}` with no `name`/`type`, which previously failed Pydantic `Entity`
  parsing. The client now follows up with `GET /entities/{id}` and returns the
  canonical merged-into entity. Fallback is limited to 404 or empty/incomplete
  canonical responses with a valid merge ID; authentication, rate-limit,
  transport, and malformed-data errors propagate. HTTP 404 now raises the
  exported `NotFoundError`, a `MemoryError` subclass. Merge details are preserved
  in `metadata.nams_resolution`, including a `fallback` flag and the separate
  `merge_confidence` score; fallback entity confidence uses the model default.
  Null confidence and collection fields use meaningful defaults, while invalid
  server IDs and explicit null/invalid creation timestamps fail validation.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-30

The NAMS-alignment release. Adds workspace addressing, a first-class
ontology surface (`client.ontology`), `conversation_id`/`type` parameter
aliases across the NAMS methods, and an explicit
`long_term.wait_for_extraction(...)` await for the asynchronous NAMS
extraction pipeline. Also makes the Google ADK `Neo4jMemoryService`
NAMS-compatible (#130). This is the first release cut from the polyglot
repository, published under namespaced `python-v*` tags.

### Added

- **Workspace addressing for NAMS.** `NamsConfig.workspace_id` (and the
  `MEMORY_WORKSPACE_ID` environment variable) is transmitted automatically
  as the `X-Workspace-Id` header on every request. This is required by
  deployments that scope by header (e.g. the development/staging service)
  rather than encoding the workspace in the API key (production, unchanged).
  An explicit `X-Workspace-Id` entry in `headers` still wins. The
  `validate_on_connect` probe sends the header so misconfiguration fails fast.
- **Ontology surface (`client.ontology`).** Drive the NAMS domain-ontology
  engine from the SDK: `list()`, `get()`, `get_active()`, `clone()`,
  `create()`, `update()`, `activate()`, `delete()` over the ~28 system
  templates, versioned revisions, and `permissive`/`strict` validation modes.
  Returns typed Pydantic models (`OntologySummary`, `OntologyVersion`,
  `OntologyDocument`, `EntityTypeDef`, …); `get_active()` surfaces the active
  version's `validation_mode`. On the bolt backend the accessor raises
  `NotSupportedError` (define a custom schema with `SchemaModel.CUSTOM`).
- **`conversation_id` alias** accepted across NAMS short-term methods
  (`add_message`, `get_conversation`, `search_messages`, `clear_session`,
  `create_conversation`, `bulk_add_messages`, …) as an alias for `session_id`.
  `session_id` wins when both are supplied; a clear error names both when
  neither is. `entity_type` gains `type`/`label` aliases on `add_entity`.
- **`long_term.wait_for_extraction(...)`** — await the asynchronous NAMS
  extraction pipeline explicitly (polls entity search for `expected_names` /
  a `predicate`; returns a boolean, no raise). A no-op returning `True` on
  bolt, where extraction is synchronous.

### Fixed

- **Google ADK `Neo4jMemoryService` is now NAMS-compatible (#130).**
  `search_memory()` is conversation-scoped on NAMS (it threads the active
  session id and skips message search gracefully when none is known, instead
  of crashing with the unscoped-search `ValueError`); tool events
  (`FunctionCall`/`FunctionResponse`) are filtered out of the entity pipeline
  rather than stringified into it, so they no longer produce empty knowledge
  graphs. Documentation parameter names are reconciled (`session_id` /
  `conversation_id`, `entity_type` / `type`). `MemoryClient` gains `backend`
  and `is_nams` properties.

### Repository

- The repository at `neo4j-labs/agent-memory` is now polyglot. A
  TypeScript SDK (`@neo4j-labs/agent-memory`, in `typescript/`) ships
  alongside the Python SDK with the same memory model and the same NAMS
  backend. _For the TypeScript SDK changelog see
  [`typescript/CHANGELOG.md`](typescript/CHANGELOG.md)._
- Python release tags are now namespaced as `python-v*` (e.g.
  `python-v0.4.1`) so they cannot collide with TypeScript tags
  (`typescript-v*`). The publish workflow has been renamed from
  `release.yml` to `publish-python.yml`.
- The CI workflow has been renamed from `ci.yml` to `ci-python.yml` and
  is now path-filtered. TypeScript-only PRs no longer trigger the
  Python test matrix.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-17

The "hosted backend" release. Headline feature is **NAMS (Neo4j Agent Memory Service) backend support** — write once against `MemoryClient`, choose between local bolt-to-Neo4j or the hosted REST service at config time. The change is purely additive — existing v0.3.x code keeps working unchanged on bolt.

### Added

- **NAMS backend** — `MemorySettings(backend="nams", nams=NamsConfig(api_key=...))` routes every `client.short_term`, `client.long_term`, `client.reasoning`, and `client.query` call to the hosted REST API at `https://memory.neo4jlabs.com/v1` (default endpoint, overridable). SPEC tier conformance targets Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum.
- **`neo4j_agent_memory.nams` package** — new public surface:
  - `NamsConfig` — endpoint, api_key (`SecretStr`), timeout, retries, headers, `validate_on_connect`, `transport_mode`.
  - `AuthProvider` Protocol + `StaticApiKeyAuth` (`Authorization: Bearer {api_key}`).
  - `HttpTransport` — httpx-based async client with retry policy (429 honors `Retry-After`, 5xx + network errors retried with exponential backoff), structured error mapping, and OpenTelemetry-style span attributes.
  - Auto-protocol detection: `/v\d+`-shaped endpoints → REST; otherwise TCK bridge protocol (`POST /{snake_case_method}`).
  - `NamsBackend` — composition root that owns the transport + three memory implementations + Cypher accessor. Used by `MemoryClient.connect()` when `backend == "nams"`.
- **`neo4j_agent_memory.core.protocols`** — three new `@runtime_checkable` Protocols (`ShortTermProtocol`, `LongTermProtocol`, `ReasoningProtocol`) plus `CypherQueryProtocol`. Existing `ShortTermMemory`/`LongTermMemory`/`ReasoningMemory` bolt classes structurally satisfy them; new `NamsShortTermMemory`/`NamsLongTermMemory`/`NamsReasoningMemory` implement them over HTTP.
- **`client.query.cypher(query, params)`** — unified read-only Cypher accessor. Works on both backends. On bolt, forwards to `Neo4jClient.execute_read`; on NAMS, forwards to `POST /v1/query` (Platinum). Read-only enforcement uses a shared `is_read_only_query` validator.
- **Platinum-tier methods** on `client.long_term` and `client.short_term`:
  - `set_entity_feedback(entity_id, feedback, user_identifier=...)`
  - `get_entity_history(entity_id, limit=...)`
  - `get_entity_provenance(entity_id)` (Gold; available on bolt and NAMS)
  - `bulk_add_messages(session_id, messages)`
  - `get_observations(session_id, limit=...)`
  - `get_reflections(session_id, limit=...)`
  - `create_conversation(session_id, ...)`
  - `list_conversations(user_identifier=..., limit=...)`

  NAMS implements them via REST; bolt is missing the Platinum surface and raises `NotSupportedError` at call time.
- **New exceptions** in `neo4j_agent_memory.core.exceptions`:
  - `TransportError(ConnectionError)` — HTTP transport failures (5xx, network).
  - `AuthenticationError(MemoryError)` — 401/403.
  - `NotSupportedError(MemoryError)` — structured with `backend`, `method`, `workaround`.
  - `RateLimitError(MemoryError)` — 429, carries `retry_after`.
  - `ValidationError(MemoryError)` — 400, carries `details`.

  Existing `except ConnectionError` blocks still catch transport failures (since `TransportError` is a subclass).
- **NAMS-flavored framework helpers**:
  - `integrations.pydantic_ai.nams_memory_tools(memory)` — base tools + Platinum tools (`set_entity_feedback`, `get_entity_history`, `get_entity_provenance`, `cypher_query`) as Pydantic AI tools.
  - `integrations.strands.nams_context_graph_tools(endpoint=..., api_key=...)` — Strands `@tool` functions for NAMS Platinum operations. Auto-reads `MEMORY_API_KEY`/`MEMORY_ENDPOINT` from env.
- **MCP server**:
  - Four new Platinum tools (`memory_set_entity_feedback`, `memory_get_entity_history`, `memory_get_entity_provenance`, `memory_get_reflections`) registered automatically when the underlying `MemoryClient` uses `backend == "nams"`.
  - `register_tools(mcp, *, profile, register_platinum)` parameter.
- **CLI** — `neo4j-agent-memory mcp serve` accepts new flags:
  - `--backend {bolt,nams}` (env: `NAM_BACKEND`)
  - `--api-key` (env: `MEMORY_API_KEY`)
  - `--endpoint` (env: `MEMORY_ENDPOINT`)
- **Environment variables** — `MEMORY_API_KEY` and `MEMORY_ENDPOINT` are recognized by `MemorySettings`. When `MEMORY_API_KEY` is set and `backend` is unspecified, the backend defaults to NAMS (otherwise bolt — preserving the historical default).
- **Documentation**:
  - `explanation/backends.adoc` — bolt vs NAMS trade-offs and feature matrix.
  - `how-to/use-nams.adoc` — first-time NAMS setup.
  - `how-to/migrate-to-nams.adoc` — porting bolt code; full `NotSupportedError` table.
  - `tutorials/nams-quickstart.adoc` — 5-minute walkthrough.
- **Examples**:
  - `examples/nams-quickstart/` — minimal end-to-end NAMS usage.
  - `examples/nams-langchain/` — LangChain `ConversationChain` backed by NAMS.
  - `examples/nams-fastapi/` — FastAPI app with lifespan-managed NAMS client.
- **Tests** — `tests/unit/nams/` (12 test files, respx-based, 320+ tests). `tests/integration/nams/` scaffold for TCK conformance suite (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum) once the TCK reference Docker image is available.

### Changed

- **`MemoryClient.connect()`** dispatches on `MemorySettings.backend`. When unset, NAMS if `MEMORY_API_KEY` is in the environment, otherwise bolt.
- **`client.graph`** raises `NotSupportedError` on NAMS — use `client.query.cypher()` for portable read-only queries. On bolt, returns a deprecation proxy that emits a one-time `DeprecationWarning` on `execute_read` calls; `execute_write` continues to work without deprecation.
- **`client.users`, `client.buffered`, `client.consolidation`** — on NAMS, accessors return a `_NamsUnsupported` sentinel that raises `NotSupportedError` with workaround hints on any method call.
- **`client.schema`** — on NAMS, returns a `_NamsUnsupported` sentinel (`adopt_existing_graph` and other schema operations are server-managed by NAMS).
- **`client.get_stats`, `client.get_graph`, `client.get_locations`** — raise `NotSupportedError` on NAMS (rely on bolt-specific Cypher; use `client.query.cypher()` with a custom query).
- **MCP `graph_query` tool, `_get_entity_neighbors` helper, `memory://graph/stats` resource** — migrated from `client.graph.execute_read` to `client.query.cypher`. Now portable across both backends.
- **Strands `context_graph_tools` internal Cypher**, **AgentCore `HybridMemoryProvider._enrich_with_relationships`**, and **`EvalMemory._eval_audit`** — same migration. All work on both backends.

### Deprecated

- **`client.graph.execute_read`** — use `client.query.cypher` for portable read-only queries. Emits one-time `DeprecationWarning` per process. Scheduled for removal in **v0.6.0**.

### Migration

Existing v0.3.x users:

* Stay on bolt → **no code changes required**.
* Switch to NAMS → set one env var:
  ```bash
  export MEMORY_API_KEY=nams_xxxxx
  ```
  `MemoryClient()` now talks to NAMS. Methods that don't apply (geocoding, enrichment, deduplication knobs) emit a single `UserWarning` at `connect()` time listing the inactive layers.
* For custom Cypher:
  ```python
  # v0.3 (deprecated, still works on bolt)
  results = await client.graph.execute_read("MATCH (n:Entity) RETURN n LIMIT 10")
  # v0.4 (works on both backends)
  results = await client.query.cypher("MATCH (n:Entity) RETURN n LIMIT 10")
  ```

See `docs/.../how-to/migrate-to-nams.adoc` for the full migration cookbook and `NotSupportedError` reference table.

### Backward compatibility

* Every public class/function from v0.3.x is importable unchanged.
* All existing examples and integration tests pass on bolt without modification.
* The SPEC-aligned method names (`add_message`, `add_entity`, `start_trace`, ...) were already present in v0.3 — they were the source for the SPEC.
* `BaseMemory[T]` ABC stays as the bolt base class; the new Protocols supplement it without replacing it.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-12

The "bring your own model" release. Headline feature is **pluggable LLM and embedding providers** — Anthropic, Bedrock, Vertex AI, local sentence-transformers, and 100+ others via LiteLLM now slot in alongside OpenAI through a single Protocol. Existing v0.2.x code keeps working with a one-time `DeprecationWarning`; the legacy `EmbeddingConfig`/`LLMConfig` types are removed in v0.5.0.

### Added

- **`neo4j_agent_memory.llm` package** — new public surface for the Provider Protocol. Three `@runtime_checkable` Protocols:
  - `LLMProvider` — chat completions (Bronze tier).
  - `StructuredExtractor` — validated Pydantic outputs (Silver tier).
  - `EmbeddingProvider` — text embeddings (Bronze tier).
  Plus types (`ChatMessage`, `Completion`, `Usage`), a provider-agnostic exception hierarchy (`ProviderError`, `ProviderRateLimitError`, `ProviderTimeoutError`, `ProviderAuthError`, `ProviderInvalidRequestError`, `ProviderServiceError`, `StructuredExtractionError`, `EmbeddingDimensionMismatchError`), a defaults lookup (`EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS`, `lookup_embedding_dimensions`), the schema-aligned retry helper (`schema_aligned_extract`), and the factory (`from_provider`).
- **Native adapters** — `OpenAIProvider`, `OpenAIEmbeddingProvider`, `AnthropicProvider` (with optional Anthropic prompt-caching via `cache_system=True`), `BedrockProvider`, `BedrockEmbeddingProvider`, `SentenceTransformersProvider`, `VertexAIEmbeddingProvider`, `InstructorProvider`.
- **Universal adapter** — `LiteLLMProvider` and `LiteLLMEmbeddingProvider` cover 100+ providers (Cohere, Voyage, Groq, Together, Mistral, Ollama, OpenRouter, ...).
- **`from_provider("provider/model", ...)`** string-shorthand factory with native-first resolution: when both a native adapter and LiteLLM are installed, the native adapter wins. Override with `prefer_litellm=True`. Unknown-extra errors include an actionable install hint.
- **Vector index dimension validation** — `SchemaManager.validate_vector_index_dimensions(expected)` runs in `MemoryClient.connect()`. A mismatch between the configured embedder's `dimensions` and an existing Neo4j vector index raises `EmbeddingDimensionMismatchError` listing every offending index and pointing at the migration runbook (`how-to/migrate-embedding-model.adoc`).
- **`MCPserve --llm` / `--embedding`** CLI flags (plus `--llm-api-key`, `--llm-api-base`, `--embedding-dimensions`) and matching `NAM_LLM` / `NAM_EMBEDDING` / `NAM_LLM_API_KEY` env vars on `neo4j-agent-memory mcp serve`.
- **LLM-driven session reflections** — `MemoryObserver(llm_provider=...)` uses the configured provider to summarize older messages when the token threshold trips. Falls back to keyword extraction on missing provider or provider error.
- **LLM-driven conversation summaries** — `ShortTermMemory(default_llm_provider=...)` wires the configured provider into `get_conversation_summary()` so the method works without an explicit `summarizer=` callable. A module-level `_llm_summarizer(provider)` helper builds the equivalent callable for user code.
- **Framework pass-through helpers** — `llm_provider_from_langchain`, `_pydantic_ai`, `_llamaindex`, `_crewai`, `_openai_agents`, `_microsoft_agent`, `_google_adk`, and `_strands` translate a framework-native model object into an `LLMProvider`. Lets users avoid double-declaring their model.
- **New installation extras** — `[litellm]` (universal fallback) and `[instructor]` (structured-output power user). `[all]` now bundles `litellm`; `[full]` adds `instructor`.
- **New tests** — `tests/unit/llm/` (foundations + contract harness + canned providers), `tests/unit/test_legacy_compat.py` (deprecation + v0.2 backward compat), `tests/unit/test_passthrough.py`, `tests/unit/test_observer_llm.py`, `tests/unit/test_short_term_summarizer.py`, `tests/unit/test_index_validate.py`.

### Changed

- **`MemorySettings.embedding` and `MemorySettings.llm`** are now union types. They accept:
  - the legacy `EmbeddingConfig` / `LLMConfig` (emits one `DeprecationWarning` per construction when user-explicit; planned removal in v0.5.0),
  - a provider-string shorthand resolved via `from_provider` (`"openai/text-embedding-3-small"`, `"anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-latest"`),
  - a fully-constructed Provider instance (the new canonical shape).
  Dict input is still coerced to legacy configs for v0.2 compatibility.
- **`MemoryClient.connect()`** sizes vector indexes from the resolved embedder's `dimensions`, not from the legacy `EmbeddingConfig.dimensions` field — works correctly when a Provider instance is configured.
- **`LLMEntityExtractor`** accepts an injected `provider: LLMProvider | StructuredExtractor`. The legacy `model=` / `api_key=` constructor signature continues to work and now constructs the provider internally via `from_provider`. When the provider also implements `StructuredExtractor`, the extractor uses `complete_structured` with a `LLMExtractionPayload` Pydantic model for native-quality structured outputs.
- **Strands integration** routes `embedding_provider` strings through `from_provider` instead of mapping to the legacy enum.

### Deprecated

- **`EmbeddingConfig` and `LLMConfig`** as values for `MemorySettings.embedding` / `MemorySettings.llm`. Passing either at construction time emits a single `DeprecationWarning` pointing at the migration guide. **Removal planned for v0.5.0.** The classes themselves remain importable through v0.5.0 for type-import usage in user code.

### Migration

Three patterns are common. Pick the one closest to your existing code.

**v0.2.x — legacy explicit configs (still works, one warning per construction):**

```python
from neo4j_agent_memory import MemoryClient, MemorySettings
from neo4j_agent_memory.config.settings import (
    EmbeddingConfig, EmbeddingProvider, LLMConfig, LLMProvider,
)

settings = MemorySettings(
    neo4j={"password": "p"},
    embedding=EmbeddingConfig(
        provider=EmbeddingProvider.OPENAI,
        model="text-embedding-3-small",
    ),
    llm=LLMConfig(provider=LLMProvider.OPENAI, model="gpt-4o-mini"),
)
```

**v0.3 — provider-string shorthand (recommended for most users):**

```python
from neo4j_agent_memory import MemoryClient, MemorySettings

settings = MemorySettings(
    neo4j={"password": "p"},
    embedding="openai/text-embedding-3-small",
    llm="anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-latest",
)
```

**v0.3 — explicit Provider instance (full control, e.g. local vLLM/Ollama):**

```python
from neo4j_agent_memory import MemoryClient, MemorySettings
from neo4j_agent_memory.llm.adapters.litellm import LiteLLMProvider

settings = MemorySettings(
    neo4j={"password": "p"},
    embedding="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5",
    llm=LiteLLMProvider(
        "ollama/llama3.2",
        api_base="http://localhost:11434",
    ),
)
```

See `docs/.../how-to/migrate-to-providers.adoc` for the full migration cookbook, including embedding-dimension migration when changing models.

### Backward compatibility

- All v0.2.x example code runs unmodified, emitting exactly one `DeprecationWarning` per `MemoryClient` construction. Verified by `tests/unit/test_legacy_compat.py`.
- The legacy `Embedder` Protocol in `neo4j_agent_memory.embeddings.base` remains; a new internal `_ProviderToEmbedderAdapter` bridges new Provider instances back to the old API for downstream memory layers that have not migrated.
- `extra="forbid"` on `MemorySettings` is preserved; field-name typos still raise.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- **`MemorySettings(...)` no longer raises `extra_forbidden` for unrelated `.env` keys.** pydantic-settings 2.x leaks `.env` keys outside the configured `env_prefix` into the validation payload, which collided with `MemorySettings`'s `extra="forbid"` (used to catch code-level typos). Common symptoms: instantiating `MemorySettings(neo4j={...})` failed with `extra_forbidden` on `neo4j_uri` / `neo4j_password` / `openai_api_key` whenever the user's `.env` contained the unprefixed equivalents (e.g. `NEO4J_URI=...` from a Docker setup, or `OPENAI_API_KEY=...` for an unrelated tool). `MemorySettings.settings_customise_sources` now wraps the dotenv source to drop keys that aren't top-level model fields. `NAM_*`-prefixed nested loads (e.g. `NAM_NEO4J__URI`) are unchanged, and the typo guard for kwargs (`MemorySettings(schema=...)`) still raises. New `TestDotEnvFiltering` regression tests in `tests/unit/test_config.py`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-04

The v0.2 feature drop. Headline feature is **adopting an existing Neo4j graph** as long-term memory; the rest are production-readiness primitives.

### Added

- **Adopt an existing graph** — `client.schema.adopt_existing_graph(label_to_type=..., name_property_per_label=...)` attaches the `:Entity` super-label and the library's required `id`/`type`/`name` properties to nodes in your existing domain graph. Idempotent. After adoption, library writes (entity extraction, MENTIONS edges, relation writes) link to your existing nodes instead of creating duplicates. New how-to: `docs/.../how-to/adopt-existing-graph.adoc`. New example: `examples/existing-graph/`.
- **Multi-tenancy** — `MemorySettings.memory.multi_tenant=True` plus a `user_identifier=` kwarg on short-term, long-term, and reasoning APIs scopes reads and writes per tenant. New `client.users` (`UserMemory`) layer for first-class `:User` identity. New how-to: `docs/.../how-to/multi-tenancy.adoc`.
- **Buffered (fire-and-forget) writes** — `MemorySettings.memory.write_mode = "buffered"` plus `client.buffered.submit(query, params)`, `client.flush()`, `client.wait_for_pending()`, and `client.write_errors`. Decouples user-visible latency from Neo4j round-trips. New how-to: `docs/.../how-to/buffered-writes.adoc`. New example: `examples/buffered-writes/`.
- **Consolidation primitives** — `client.consolidation` exposes `dedupe_entities()`, `summarize_long_traces()`, `detect_superseded_preferences()`, and `archive_expired_conversations()`. All default to `dry_run=True`. New how-to: `docs/.../how-to/consolidation.adoc`.
- **Evaluation harness** — `client.eval.run(EvalSuite(...))` for labelled regression tests over memory quality (recall@k for retrieval, audit-coverage of `:TOUCHED` paths, preference fidelity). New how-to: `docs/.../how-to/evaluation.adoc`. New example: `examples/eval-harness/`.
- **Audit-trail / TOUCHED edges** — `record_tool_call(touched_entities=[...])`, `@client.reasoning.on_tool_call_recorded` hook for domain-specific inference, `TraceOutcome` with indexable `error_kind`. Headline payoff: a one-hop `MATCH (e)<-[:TOUCHED]-(s)` audit query. New how-to: `docs/.../how-to/audit-reasoning.adoc`. New example: `examples/audit-trail/`.
- **Privacy & encryption** — `core.encryption` helper plus `docs/.../how-to/privacy-and-audit.adoc`.
- **Schema objects reference** — declarative constraints/indexes documented at `docs/.../reference/schema-objects.adoc`.
- **Glossary page** — `docs/.../glossary.adoc`.
- **README async-only callout** — explicit guidance that every memory operation is a coroutine.
- **Generic phantom-method guard** — `tests/examples/test_no_phantom_methods.py` cross-references every `client.<layer>.<method>(` call in `examples/` against the actual class API. Catches silent breakage when an example calls a method that doesn't exist (typically renamed or never landed).
- **Smoke test for `enrichment_example.py`** — `tests/examples/test_enrichment_example.py`.

### Changed

- All 14 example READMEs migrated to the Neo4j Labs branding template (Labs badge, status badge, community-supported badge, disclaimer block, support section, "verified against" footer). New top-level `examples/README.md` index.

### Fixed (during the v0.2 examples-review pass)

- `examples/google_cloud_integration/adk_memory_service.py` — printed code-example showed deprecated `await memory_client.initialize()`; corrected to `await memory_client.connect()`.
- `examples/enrichment_example.py` — called phantom `client.long_term.get_entity(entity.id)` (no such public method); fixed to `get_entity_by_name(entity.name)`.
- `examples/basic_usage.py` — called phantom `client.long_term.get_entity_coordinates()`; fixed to `get_location_coordinates()`. Also tightened `add_entity()` callers to consistently demonstrate the v0.1.1+ tuple return.
- `examples/langchain_agent.py` — same `add_entity()` consistency fix.
- `examples/lennys-memory/scripts/load_transcripts.py` — called phantom `client.short_term.get_messages()`; fixed to use `get_conversation()` and check `.messages`. The previous call was wrapped in `except Exception: pass`, so it silently failed at runtime, defeating the dedup check on transcript loads.
- `examples/lennys-memory/backend/src/api/routes/threads.py` — called phantom `client.short_term.delete_conversation()`; fixed to `clear_session()`. Also wrapped in `except Exception: pass`, so the thread-delete endpoint was silently returning success without actually deleting from Neo4j.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- **Optional LLM (`llm=None`)**: `MemorySettings.llm` is now `Optional[LLMConfig]`. Pass `llm=None` to construct a fully working `MemoryClient` without any LLM provider — useful for air-gapped environments, deployments without an `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and deterministic local-only extraction. A new `examples/no_llm/` example and a "Run Without an LLM" how-to guide demonstrate the spaCy/GLiNER-only setup.

### Changed

- **Validator on `MemorySettings`**: setting `llm=None` together with extraction settings that require an LLM (`extractor_type=ExtractorType.LLM`, or `extractor_type=PIPELINE` with `enable_llm_fallback=True`) now raises a `ValidationError` at construction time, naming both fields and suggesting the minimal fix. Omitting the `llm` field entirely preserves the historical default of auto-filling an `LLMConfig` when an LLM stage is enabled, so existing code is unaffected.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Fact and Preference Deduplication on Creation** (PR [#97](https://github.com/neo4j-labs/agent-memory/pull/97)): `add_fact()` and `add_preference()` now check for existing entries with matching subject/predicate (or category/preference) and >0.95 embedding similarity. When a duplicate is found, the existing record is returned with `metadata["deduplicated"] = True`, and confidence is updated when the new value is higher.
- **Metadata on `memory_add_fact` MCP Tool** (PR [#103](https://github.com/AhmedHamadto/agent-memory/pull/103)): Exposed the `metadata` parameter on the `memory_add_fact` MCP tool, matching the existing `memory_add_entity` interface and the underlying `LongTermMemory.add_fact()` API.
- **AWS Strands Multi-Agent Financial Services Example** (PR [#99](https://github.com/neo4j-labs/agent-memory/pull/99)): Aligned the AWS and GCP financial services examples with shared entity extraction, visualization, and persistent investigation patterns.

### Fixed

- **Google ADK `BaseMemoryService` Inheritance** (PR [#106](https://github.com/neo4j-labs/agent-memory/pull/106), PR [#107](https://github.com/neo4j-labs/agent-memory/pull/107)): `Neo4jMemoryService` now inherits from `google.adk.memory.BaseMemoryService` for proper ADK compatibility, with stricter package detection and updated method signatures (`search_memory` return type).
- **LlamaIndex Remote Timeout** (PR [#102](https://github.com/neo4j-labs/agent-memory/pull/102)): Adjusted timeout handling in the LlamaIndex integration.
