"""Tests for nams/_unsupported.py — the _NamsUnsupported sentinel shim.

Used in Phase 5 by ``MemoryClient`` to stand in for bolt-only accessors
(``client.users``, ``client.buffered``, ``client.consolidation``) when
``backend="nams"``. Property access on the sentinel is harmless;
attempting to call a method raises :class:`NotSupportedError` with a
structured message naming the accessor and method.
