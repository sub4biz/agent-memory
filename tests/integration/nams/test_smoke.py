"""Live-NAMS integration smoke — one happy path through all three memory types.

If this fails, something is fundamentally wrong with the v0.4 client.
The TCK tier suites (``test_tck_bronze.py`` onwards) exercise each
method individually for diagnostic value; this file is the single
overall "does anything work at all" smoke.

Note on NAMS semantics
======================

Unlike bolt — which creates conversations implicitly on the first
``add_message`` — NAMS (Platinum tier) requires explicit conversation
creation. The ``nams_session`` fixture in ``conftest.py`` handles this:
it calls ``create_conversation()`` first and returns the canonical id
NAMS expects for subsequent calls.
